## Installation
Budget Tracker is an easy-to-use, in-browser budget tracking app. No installations are required. However, because it is a PWA, you can install the app for use offline.
## Usage 

Track your budget online and offline with the PWA budget tracker. Type in the name of your transaction, the amount of money you gained or lost in the transaction, and hit "Add Funds" or "Subtract Funds". The graph below will show you your change in money over time, and provide you a total funds at the top.

## Tests
There are no tests written at this time.

## Future Development
I would change the name and look if I ever wanted to pass this off as my own work, but that feels evil, so I won't. I did not write the bulk of the code here, just the offline functionality in the manifest.json file and the service-worker.js file.
